# DevDesk Backend by Lambda EU4 Team

This Backend was created for the Node Build Week Project of Emma Andrews & Niklas Becker called DevDesk.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Install the Dev-Dependencies with 
```
npm i -D
```
run the command: 
```
npm run tests
```

### Tests that are available

There are tests available for each endpoint, each model, and every single middleware.

Some examples:

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

We recommend deploying this backend on Heroku with Postgres. A matching JWT-Secret & the following DB_ENV variable needs to be decleared in Herokus config vars.

```
DB_ENV          production
JWT_SECRET      exampleSecret
```
